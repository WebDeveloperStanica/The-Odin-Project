    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For this satisfying dish, cabbage leaves are stuffed with a seasoned mixture of rice, ground beef, pork and ham. 
        They are then laid on a bed of sauerkraut and simmered to completion. 
        This is the best stuffed cabbage recipe I've ever tried.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large head cabbage</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground ham</li>
        <li>1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound sauerkraut</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato juice</li>
        <li>water to cover</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place cabbage in the freezer for a few days. The night before making the rolls, take it out to thaw.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the beef, pork, ham, rice, onion, egg, garlic powder, salt and pepper.
            Mix well. Form meat mixture into oblong balls, using 1/2 cup of the mixture at a time. Then, wrap a cabbage
            leaf around each ball.
        </li>
        <li>Spread the sauerkraut in the bottom of a large pot, then layer cabbage rolls on top, pacing them
            seam-side down. Pour tomato juice over rolls, then add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce
            heat to low and simmer for about 3 hours, addng more water as necessary.
