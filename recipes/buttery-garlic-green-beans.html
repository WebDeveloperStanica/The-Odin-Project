    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Green bean recipes make the greatest side dishes. They take very little time to cook and, 
        depending on the method, even less time to prep. This easy recipe for saut√©ed green beans is a 
        perfect case in point. It preps in just 5 minutes, cooks in about 10 (depending on how crunchy 
        you like your green beans), and is ready in 15 minutes. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Green Beans</li>
            <li>a little butter</li>
            <li>minced garlic</li>
            <li>lemon</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim the green beans, placed the trimmed beans into a large skillet, cover with cold
                water, bring to a boil and simmer until they's just tender. For this green bean recipe,
                it's better to undercook slightly than overcook. Total cook time will depend on the size
                of your beans and how you like them. For crisp-tender beans, you will need less time.
                Drain the green beans and return them to the skillet. The residual heat will continue to
                cook the green beans.
            </li>
            <li>Add butter to the hot skillet and stir until melted. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to
                2 minutes, making sure the beans are coated with the garlicy butter. Season and serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
